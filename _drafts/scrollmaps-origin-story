ScrollMaps (TODO: add link) is a simple browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that allows users to pan the map using the two-finger-scrolling gesture.

It started out back in 2012, not long after I got my first MacBook. It was a MacBook air with a multi-touch trackpad, which at the time was relatively uncommon. My previous laptop, for comparison, was a Dell that as a region on the right side of the trackpad reserved for vertical scrolling.
